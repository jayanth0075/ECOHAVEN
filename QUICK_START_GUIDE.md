## 🔧 How to Customize

### Change Brand Data

**File:** `src/pages/challenges.js`

```javascript
const ecoBrandRedirects = [
  {
    id: 'ecoearth',           // URL slug
    name: 'Eco Earth',        // Display name
    description: '...',       // Tagline
    icon: '🌍'                // Emoji
  }
];
```

**File:** `src/pages/brand.js`

```javascript
const brandData = {
  ecoearth: {
    name: 'Eco Earth',
    tagline: '...',
    description: '...',
    discount: '20% OFF',
    color: '#10b981',         // Brand color (hex)
    icon: '🌍',
    products: ['Product 1', 'Product 2', ...],
    benefits: ['Benefit 1', 'Benefit 2', ...]
  }
};
```

### Change Colors

**File:** `src/styles/challenges.css` or `src/styles/brand.css`

Search for color hex values:
- `#10b981` - Primary green
- `#0891b2` - Teal accent
- `#f97316` - Orange (brands)

### Adjust Animation Speed

Look for `transition` properties:
```css
transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1);
         /* duration: 300ms, easing function */
```

Reduce duration (e.g., `0.2s`) for faster animations
Increase duration (e.g., `0.5s`) for slower animations
